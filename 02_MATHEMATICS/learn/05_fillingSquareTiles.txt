Problem :- There is a M * N size floor, we have to find the  maximum length 
of square Tiles, by using which we can fill the whole floor. What will be the 
length of the Tiles?

Solution :- The Solution is very simple, what we have to do is that 
we have to find the maximum number which can devide both of the numbers
M and N, so for doing this we have a concept of greatest common divisor. 
There are many methods for calculating the greatest common divisor of 
highest common factor of two numbers, we will make the program for gcd in 
the next section.
